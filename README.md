# Tic Tac Toe Pro Printing Utility

## Introduction
"Tic Tac Toe Pro" is a magic effect produced by Bond Lee. Printing images to customize it always seemed more difficult than it needed to be.  So, I created a utility for my own use to make it easier. I thought I'd share it in case other people might find it useful.

Please be aware, I am not affiliated with Bond Lee, the creator of this effect. I'm just a performer who uses it. So, if you're looking for information about how it works, how to perform it, where to get it, you won't find it here. However, if you're an authorized user who'd like an easier way to print customized images, this could be what you're looking for.

Simply select size of your Tic Tac Toe Pro and provide the image you wish to use. Print it out directly from your browser. It will print one square per page. If you're using the stage size, each square will be split across two pages for printing on letter size paper. (Or A4, if that's your thing.) Just cut them out, attach them, and you're good to go.

## Usage
Open the page in your browser. This utility was designed for the Chrome browser, though it should work reasonably well in any modern browser. If you run into trouble with other browsers, you may want to give it a try in Chrome.

Select the size you are using, and the size of the paper you will be printing on. Optionally, you can adjust the other settings.

Then, click the "Choose File" button and select your desired image file. The image should be JPEG, PNG, or GIF format. Ideally, you should use a square image, large enough for printing at your desired size. The image will be automatically scaled to fit, but a small image won't look good printed at a large size. Ideally, I'd recommend a minimum of 2303x2303 pixels for parlor size, or 4429x44429 pixels for stage size.

Finally, click print. (Be sure scaling is set to 100%. You may need to remove headers or adjust margins.)

### Settings
There are a few settings you can adjust. Click on "Settings" to open the settings panel.

#### Overlap
When a square is split across two pages, this value controls the amount the two pieces will overlap where they meet. You can set it to 0cm, if you wish to have no overlap.

#### Background
This is the background color for the image. It will only be visible if the image you are using is not square or has transparent areas. If you change the background color, you will need to reload your image to see the change.
